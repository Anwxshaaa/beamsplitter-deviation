The values obtained while doing the experiment are as follows:

| Beam Splitter | Transmittance T (V) | Reflectance R (V) | Steering Mirror (V) | R/T Ratio |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| BS1           | 1.087                | 1.308               | 2.434                 | 1.203      |
| BS2           | 1.074                | 1.188               | 2.423                 | 1.106      |
| BS3           | 1.190                | 1.266               | 2.243                 | 1.063      |

To normalise the values we use the given formula:

### $R_{norm}$ = $\frac{R}{Steering Mirror}$

### $T_{norm}$ = $\frac{T}{Steering Mirror}$

### Split Ratio = $R_{norm}$ : $T_{norm}$

We have obtained two plots:
  1. A overall Michelson Interference Fringe pattern when the phase is sweeped from 0&deg - 360&deg
  2. Zoomed in version for 170&deg - 190&deg to see the deviation from ideal 50:50 condition

We can conclude that there exists small discrepencies resulting in deviation of the pattern from the ideal conditions. The experimentally obtained values are almost similar but very slight deviations highlighting the recombination at the output is not accurate.
Even a very small variation in the unprocessed data can cause hindrance in the optical output of the interferometer
